Yuchen Liao — Academic Homepage
================================

This is a minimal, static academic homepage. It can be hosted with GitHub Pages.

Structure
- `index.html`: Main site content.
- `assets/style.css`: Simple styling (no build step, no JS needed).

How to host on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new public repo on GitHub (e.g., `yuchen-liao.github.io` or any name).
2. Add these files to the repo and push to `main`.
3. In the repo, go to Settings → Pages:
   - Source: `Deploy from a branch`
   - Branch: `main` (root)
4. Save. After a minute, the site will be available at the Pages URL shown.

Customizing
- Update contact info, affiliations, publications, and teaching sections in `index.html`.
- Replace or remove any links as needed. The CV link currently points to the GitHub file listed on the prior Google Sites page.

Notes
- The publication entries include arXiv and journal links from the current site where available.
- If you want a custom domain, add a `CNAME` file with your domain, and configure DNS to point to GitHub Pages.
